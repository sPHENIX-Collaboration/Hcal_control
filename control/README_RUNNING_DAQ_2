All,

Joe first - thanks for the new prototype firmware, works like a charm
and on the first shot. We now have more units to work with.

(That was making the clock on the prototypes the 56.299 MHz that we run
at now)

Dan^2, Joey, Stefan, Silas - I'll move you HCal guys over to a prototype
unit called gtm02 (gtm01 is currently taken for the TPC). This is the
follow-through on what I promised at the coll. meeting, that most
detectors will have their own unit to work with, and can work
undisturbed by whatever everyone else is doing. So no more coordinating
between the LL1 crowd and the HCal crowd - you are no longer sharing the
"zcu102" GTM.

The only thing you need to be aware of is that you need the right
definition of the GTMHOST env. variable in the shell you work from on
daq01. By default it is
 

    [phnxrc@daq01 ~]$ echo $GTMHOST
    zcu102

(that's in the .bash_login) and if you work with the HCal, you need some
discipline to set

GTMHOST=gtm02

I can see a number of mis-fires coming here (I had my share of those
when we were switching between zcu102 and gtm01), so I will think of a
way of making it less error-prone.

The other thing to remember is that, in absence of a minipod
multiple-fiber MPO, you will use 2 vGTMs (0 and 1) for west and east, respectively,
and need to load the modebits to both if you run both.

Sorry I should have added that I added those initially ad-hoc files to their proper place in git and am so able to install everything consistently, rather than copying from here to there. So do

load_modebits 0 /usr/local/share/gl1gtm/led_running.scheduler

for west and vGTM 1 for east. (I went up to see Dan and explained - we saw data)
